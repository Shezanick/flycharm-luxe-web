            <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
            <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use Flycharm's services. By using our services, you represent and warrant that you meet this age requirement and have the legal capacity to enter into these Terms.</p>

            <h2>4. Price-Beat Guarantee</h2>

            <h3>Our Commitment</h3>
            <p>Flycharm offers a Price-Beat Guarantee on all bookings. If we cannot beat a like-for-like quote from a legitimate competitor for the same travel dates, destinations, and service class, you will not be charged our service fee.</p>
